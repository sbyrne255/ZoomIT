BECAUSE OF SOME FUCK SHIT WITH THE MS VS 2012 ASSEMBLY INCLUDES NOT COPYING ALL DEPENENCIES CORRECTLY,
I AM JUST INCLUDING THEM MANUALLY FROM THE RELEASE BIN (WORKS FINE IN VS12, INSTALLED VERSIONS DON'T WORK) DUE TO THIS APPLICATION ALREADY
BEING OUTDATED WHEN I AM WRITING IT THIS HACK AROUND IS BEING PUBLISHED, IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE FILES JUST REMEMBER TO INCLUDE THEM FROM THE RELEASE BIN
RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE INSTALLER DEPENENCIES.

THANK YOU, THAT IS ALL.
